    <h2>Abstract VS Interface</h2>
    <p>
        Type of methods: Interface can have only abstract methods. An abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods. From Java 8, it can have default and static methods also. From Java 9, it can have private concrete methods as well.
        Final Variables: Variables declared in a Java interface are by default final. An abstract class may contain non-final variables.
        Type of variables: Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables. The interface has only static and final variables.
        Implementation: Abstract class can provide the implementation of the interface. Interface can’t provide the implementation of an abstract class.
        Inheritance vs Abstraction: A Java interface can be implemented using the keyword “implements” and an abstract class can be extended using the keyword “extends”.
        Multiple implementations: An interface can extend one or more Java interfaces; an abstract class can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces.
        Multiple Inheritance:  Interface supports multiple inheritance; an abstract class does not support multiple inheritance.
        Accessibility of Data Members: Members of a Java interface are public by default. A Java abstract class can have class members like private, protected, etc.

            <h2>Inheritance In Function Constructor</h2>
    <p>

            Here, we will discuss inheriting a constructor function in JavaScript. Constructor functions define the prototype of the properties an object will contain. Using the constructor function, we can create a new object after passing the required parameters.

            Inheriting a previously defined constructor function means using the parameters of the previously defined function along with adding some new parameters to the newly defined constructor function. For this, we need to use the call() function which allows us to call a function defined somewhere else in the current context. 

    </p>
    Syntax:

    <p class="syntax">
        myFunction.call( this, property1, property2, ... , propertyN )
    </p>
